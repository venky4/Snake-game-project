# Snake Game in Python

## Description

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control the snake's movement and collect food, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or with itself.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of your score, which increases as you eat more food.
- Game over screen: When the game ends, you'll see your final score and the option to restart the game.

## How to Play
